Team Contribution:
The primary challenge we faced as a team was the lack of effective communication across different sections of the project. Since each member was responsible for different classes, coordination on class structure, access modifiers, and dependencies was insufficient, leading to integration issues and misunderstandings in the projectâ€™s overall structure. This particularly affected the consistency between header files and class implementations.

Individual Contribution:
My primary contribution involved modifying the CMake configuration to ensure a seamless integration for the final presentation of the code. I wrote the test program, debugged various components, and integrated the entire program. A significant portion of my work was dedicated to debugging. For example, there were issues with incorrect access specifiers (private vs public) in the User class, which resulted in access violations. Additionally, features across different classes were not well-aligned, causing conflicts and errors during compilation.

The communication gaps regarding project structure further compounded these issues, especially when it came to organizing header files. Many were incorrectly set up or out of sync, which resulted in considerable troubleshooting effort. Moreover, managing the CMake configuration was challenging, as it required extensive modifications to ensure that the project could compile and link correctly across different environments and contributions.
