### Contribution Statement

#### **Team Overview:**
I deeply appreciate the hard work and dedication from my teammates on this project. Our success in completing the project on time is a result of effective cooperation and timely communication throughout the process. During Sprint 0, we worked closely as a team to lay the groundwork for the project. We held a comprehensive overview meeting a week before the sprint deadline to align our initial plans.

#### **My Contribution:**
My primary contribution for this sprint was to create the Product Backlog Items (PBIs) in GitHub. Drawing on the interview notes and the brainstorming sessions we had using the blackboard, I developed the abstract requirements and translated them into detailed user stories. The PBIs I created consist of two parts: user stories and operational descriptions. 

I ensured that each PBI was described from both perspectives—capturing the user’s requirements while outlining the necessary technological functionalities and non-functional behaviors. By addressing both sides, I aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of what needed to be developed, ensuring that our approach was aligned with the project's goals and user expectations.
