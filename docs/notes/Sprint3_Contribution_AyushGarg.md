# Contribution Statement

## Team

Our team continues to demonstrate strong collaborative momentum and technical growth. 

## Individual Contributions

### 1. UI Framework Integration and Development

- Successfully integrated wxWidgets into our build system by:
  - Configuring CMake for proper wxWidgets dependency management
  - Setting up necessary compiler flags and link dependencies
- Developed an initial wxWidgets application that:
  - Implements a proof-of-concept robot management interface
  - Demonstrates integration with our existing user management system
  - Provides a foundation for future UI development

### 2. Architecture and Documentation Refinement

- Conducted a comprehensive revision of the class diagrams to:
  - Better reflect our current understanding of system components
  - Improve representation of class relationships and dependencies
  - Ensure alignment with actual implementation requirements
- Updated the class documentation to:
  - Accurately reflect new architectural decisions
  - Provide clearer explanation of class responsibilities

### 3. System Integration

- Created bridges between:
  - User management components and the wxWidgets interface
  - Robot status display and underlying data structures

## Impact

These contributions have:
- Established a solid foundation for our graphical user interface
- Enhanced the overall architectural coherence of the system

Moving forward, I will focus on expanding the UI capabilities and ensuring seamless integration with our evolving backend systems.
