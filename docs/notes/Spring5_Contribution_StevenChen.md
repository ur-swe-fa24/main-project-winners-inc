# Team Progress:
Final Work! We finished our work and finished the final testing. Now, the program is well-structured, with each system having their own responsibility, with minimal overlapping. We add the final panel: Analytics for the senior managers, where I also added the error rate. 

# Individual Contribution:
During this sprint, I dedicated approximately 12 to 14 hours refining the overall structure of the program. Initially, we had significant logic overlap—particularly in movement, cleaning, and charging processes—across the robot, simulator, and scheduler components. My primary focus was to carefully separate these concerns, ensuring each module handles only its intended responsibilities. This effort involved analyzing our previously unexamined code to remove redundancies and establish a more cohesive architecture. The result is a clearer, more maintainable system: the movement logic is now straightforward, the task queue operates smoothly, and the alert system reliably reflects the robot's operational state.
In addition to resolving these structural and logical complexities, I implemented the analytics panel—a new feature designed specifically for senior managers. Through this panel, they can review detailed robot performance metrics, including error counts and calculated error rates, enabling more informed decision-making. Overall, my contributions this sprint significantly improved code clarity, enhanced functionality, and introduced robust analytics capabilities to support strategic oversight.
