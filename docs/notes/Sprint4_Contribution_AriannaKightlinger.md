# Team Progress
This sprint went well in terms of what work to do. It was very easy to decide who would be working on what because we now better understand eachothers strengths. However this week was really rough becuase we had a lot of merge conflicts. We were able to work through them but it was definitely frustrating.
# Individual Progress
For this sprint, I worked on the Unit Testing. There were some classes that have not yet been created/ implemented so I decided to creat test driven development for this particular library. Other libraries I was able to start all the unit testing for them and fix the cmake. Ayush was kind enough to help me fix the errors I was getting as well. I also worked hard on trying to manage all the merge conflicts and communicate effectively through these.
