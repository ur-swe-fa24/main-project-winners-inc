# Team Progress
This sprint was really hard to find a time to meet because of spring break and just other plans and work we had going on. Although it was hard we were able to meet and effectively communicated our concerns. During class we were able to delegate the work everyone, making sure everyone was comfortable.

# Individual Progress
For this sprint, I worked on creating the cmake for the entire project. I ensured that both the root and app cmakelists had what they needed. I then looked into the dependencies and updated that as well. I also just meet with the team and helped go over concerns about arcitecture and design.
