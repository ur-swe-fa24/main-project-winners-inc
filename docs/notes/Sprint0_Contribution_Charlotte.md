# Group Contributions
Thus far, our group as a team has been very successful. 
We worked together, both during class time as well as outside of the classroom, to brainstorm how we would break down the overarching project into sprintable PBIs.
Everyone has done a great job of communicating and keeping each other up-to-date on our individual progress. 
When I've had questions arise, my group members have been very quick to respond and have provided me with helpful information. 

# Personal Contributions
During Sprint 0, my primary contributions included:
1. Working with teammates to figure out how to break the project into sprintable PBIs. 
2. Creating a tree-like diagram (to break down the project into more digestable categories/pieces) that my groupmates referenced as they worked on Sprint 0.  
3. Customer Interview Document
