# Team Progress
With this being our last sprint I think we have developed a lot as a team and have understood all of our assignments this week. We have become a great team and I am sad that it is coming to an end.
# Individual Progress
For this sprint, I worked on the Unit Testing again. Everything was refactored this week which meant there were a lot of errors regarding how classes implemented eachother. After a lot of refactoring and decoupling there were leftover errors. These are what I handled, finding the little errors throughout the code and making sure they became up to standard. While writing unit test I also did a lot of the merging and testing for the team to make sure our new edis were working.
