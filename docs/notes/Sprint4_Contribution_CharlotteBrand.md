# Team Progress
During this sprint, our team carefully worked through the difficulties of handling merge conflicts. Despite the anticipated frustration of the situation, our team did a great job of keeping our cool and helping each other sort out these issues. Additionally, we all continued to uphold our goal of maintaining open lines of communication with one another and taking time to meet outside of class to discuss project work. Moreover, we have all done a better job of taking advantage of the time being offered to work on our projects during class. 

# Individual Progress
Throughout this sprint, I offered help to my teammates with resolving merge conflicts, which I, unfortunately, have become familiar with during my work on the Practicums and Sprint 3; due to my experience with resolving these conflicts in the past, I was able to offer guidance to my teammates who were more unfamiliar with these issues. In addition to my help in resolving merge conflicts, I also created the *USER_GUIDE.md* and *README.md* files. Additionally, I worked on some of the implementation for the robot's scheduling system; although it is not fully operational yet, the implementation of these classes during this sprint will serve as a foundation for the work to be completed during our final sprint.
