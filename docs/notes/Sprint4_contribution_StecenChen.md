## Team Contribution
In this sprint, our team made significant progress in advancing the project to a new level, laying a solid foundation for the next sprint. This momentum positions us to further enhance our system's functionality and usability while continuing to innovate and refine our approach.

## Individual Contribution
I contributed to the project by developing the Robot Simulator system and integrating it seamlessly into the user interface through an animation demonstration. The Robot Simulator system was designed to execute a continuous loop, monitoring specific conditions and triggering events within the system as needed. Additionally, I implemented the SimulatorFrame, which serves as a bridge between the simulation logic and the user interface by responding to user interactions and clicks within the system.

I also created the Map System, which utilizes a route-finding algorithm to identify the shortest path while incorporating virtual walls to effectively segment the room into manageable areas. This functionality enhances the efficiency and precision of our navigation system.

Furthermore, I updated several core components of the project, including the Robot, Room, and Alert modules, to align with the new functionality requirements and ensure consistency throughout the system. These updates enhance the overall robustness and adaptability of the codebase, allowing for more complex and dynamic interactions within the system.

Through these contributions, I aimed to deliver a well-rounded and scalable system that will support ongoing development in future sprints.
