# Sprint 5 Contribution Statement - Ayush Garg

## Overview

During Sprint 5, I focused on implementing the **TaskScheduler** system, addressing critical bugs, enhancing error handling, and streamlining constructors to improve the system's overall efficiency and maintainability. I also worked closely with my teammates, helping them at each stage and ensuring all tests were functional and reliable.

## Key Contributions

- **Task Scheduler:** Designed and implemented a robust task scheduling system with thread-safe priority queues, task state handling, and detailed logging, ensuring smooth integration with robot functionality.  
- **Error Handling:** Enhanced error detection and debugging with improved messages, checks for virtual walls, and proper handling of missing robots or charging stations.  
- **Testing Infrastructure:** Reorganized and expanded test coverage, added queue persistence checks, and ensured reliable initialization for seamless testing.  
- **System Improvements:** Fixed charging and movement logic, optimized robot state management, and ensured cross-platform compatibility.  
- **Constructor Streamlining:** Refactored and streamlined constructors across the codebase for better clarity and efficiency.  
- **Team Support:** Actively supported teammates at every stage, collaborating to solve issues and verifying that all tests passed successfully.  

## Reflection

This sprint was an incredible learning experience, and I feel grateful for the opportunity to work with such a dedicated team. By contributing across various areas and ensuring system-wide improvements, Iâ€™ve gained valuable insights into collaborative problem-solving and system optimization.
