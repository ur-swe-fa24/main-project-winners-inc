# Contribution

## Team

Our team has demonstrated resilience and strong collaboration, even in the face of challenges. Despite Steven and Charlotte being unwell recently, we have maintained open and effective communication to ensure everyone stays informed and engaged. We are collectively working to catch up on any pending tasks, and I am confident that we remain on schedule with our project deliverables.

## Individual

I proactively led the brainstorming and development of the initial class diagrams for our system. By thoroughly analyzing the sequence and use case diagrams, I devised a new infrastructure that emphasizes scalability and maintainability. My focus was not only on the technical architecture but also on integrating robust user permission mechanisms and enhancing the overall user experience (UX). Understanding the importance of a seamless interface, I also designed comprehensive wireframes for our application. These wireframes align with our infrastructure and UX considerations, providing a clear visual guide for the development team to follow. My contributions aim to lay a strong foundation for the project's success and ensure that both the technical and user-facing aspects are well-integrated.
