## Team
The team is working efficiently and collaboratively, ensuring clear communication and division of tasks.
## Individual
I contributed to the project by defining and documenting the four key use cases: Alerts and Errors, Managing Tasks, Robot Analytics, and Robot Functions. I developed detailed user stories, and some sequence diagrams to ensure the system's functionality and user interaction were outlined. Additionally, I collaborated with the team to refine the operational requirements and provided input on real-time alerts and task management.
