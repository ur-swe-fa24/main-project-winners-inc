# Team Progress
During this sprint, our team faced some challenges with finding a time when we all were available to meet and discuss the project. However, we all maintained open lines of communication and tried to be flexible with our schedules, so we ultimately were able to find time to get together as a group. When we met, we successfully talked through some concerns about our project's architecture and dependencies between some classes. Overall, I think we've done a great job of working together during this sprint. 

# Individual Progress
In this sprint, I worked on creating the .h and .cpp files for Alert and AlertSystem which are both crucial to the functionality of the alert system user story. I also think that I've done a good job of motivating the team and communicating to get the group together to address any questions or concerns about the project.
