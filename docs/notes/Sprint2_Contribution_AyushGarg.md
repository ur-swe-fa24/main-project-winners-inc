# Contribution

## Team

During this sprint, our team collaborated effectively and maintained strong communication. Even though the sprint was relatively light, we ensured that all tasks were organized and completed efficiently. Everyone stayed engaged and contributed to keeping the project on schedule. The open dialogue within the team allowed us to address any issues promptly and support each other's efforts.

## Individual

In this sprint, I focused on creating the `User`, `Role`, and `Permission` classes, which are crucial components of our system's security and access control mechanisms. By implementing these classes, I laid the groundwork for user authentication and authorization within the application. Additionally, I helped the team establish a clear structure for this sprint by organizing tasks and setting priorities. My contributions aimed to enhance the project's architecture and facilitate a smoother workflow for the team.
