Team Contribution: Our team worked effectively and collaboratively on this project, going beyond the initial requirements by integrating a MongoDB database, adding adapters, and implementing threading to manage adapter functions. These enhancements aimed to optimize interaction with the database and improve overall functionality.

Individual Contribution: My primary contribution was developing MongoDB adapters to manage the alert system and robot status updates. I designed these adapters to load status information into the database, enabling us to monitor and ensure that threading mechanisms prevent race conditions in concurrent operations.
