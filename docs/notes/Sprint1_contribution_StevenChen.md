## Contribution Statement
### Team Overview:
I am grateful for the collaborative spirit and commitment from my teammates during this sprint. As a team, we maintained open lines of communication and worked through design iterations efficiently, allowing us to finalize key architectural decisions. Our ability to come together and discuss feedback was instrumental in completing our tasks on time and ensuring a solid foundation for the project.

### My Contribution:
My primary responsibility for Sprint 1 was to develop the architecture description and the architecture design for the project. I utilized draw.io to create visual representations of our system architecture, focusing on capturing all necessary components and their interactions. After creating the initial drafts, I shared the diagrams with my teammates to gather feedback, and we collaboratively refined the design.

Through multiple discussions, we finalized a design that met both functional requirements and non-functional criteria. I made sure the architecture provided clarity on system behaviors, data flow, and component relationships. The final architecture reflects our team's collective input, and we are satisfied with the outcome as it provides a strong blueprint for further development.
