# Contribution
## Team
Our group worked well together. We had talked over our initial plans in class and were able to do a lot of brainstorming before meeting to directly work on this Sprint. Everyone contributed something to the team and overall was a smooth process.

## Individual
I had a few contributions to the group including my notes, brainstorming, and overview of PBIs. My contribution to the customer interview document was the extensive notes I had took during our customer interview, they paired well with the notes given to us to complete this document. In class during the brainstorming process, I came up with a few abstract user stories that we were able to narrow down into PBIs. Lastly, I then looked over all the PBIs in our project task board to ensure we had all over our overarching ideas. While going through these PBIs, I checked with the staffing doc to assign them the correct priority and estimates.
