# Team Progress
Throughout this sprint, every member of our team did a great job of following through with our assigned tasks and duties. Everyone did a great job of communicating-- whether that be communicating our availability for meeting times, or letting others know what files we're working on so that we could avoid more merge conflicts. As always, we all helped each other out when other teammates were struggling, and we cheered each other on as we neared the finish line. We finished out strong and I'm proud of what our team has accomplished! 

# Individual Progress
During this sprint, I worked on implementing some of the user stories listed on our project task board and updating some of the design documents. From the task board, I worked on sending alerts when water/battery levels became low, checking robot statuses to ensure that a given robot is equipped to handle a task before being assigned to one, and some other alert-related tasks. Also, for the documentation updates, I worked on USER_GUIDE.md and README.md. I think I did a good job of collaborating with my teammates during this sprint, and I look forward to sharing our work with the rest of the class.
