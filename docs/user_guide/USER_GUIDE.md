# Robot Cleaning App by winners.inc
Thank you for choosing Cleanly by winners.inc! This guide will help walk you through the essential steps to get the most out of using your CleanBot.

## Introduction
Welcome to Cleanly! Your CleanBot is equipped with intelligent navigation, a variety of cleaning settings tailored to all floor types, and a user-friendly app to manage your cleans. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and operating your CleanBot to keep your floors squeaky clean!

# Setting Up Your Robot
## Setting Up Your Account
Upon the delivery of your robot, one of our Cleanly field engineers will help you set up your account through the Cleanly app. Once they have helped you with the set-up process, you will be able to easily log into your account using your unique username and password.

## Creating a Map
In addition to helping you set up your Cleanly account, our Cleanly field engineers will also help you with uploading a map of your building into your CleanBot's memory. This map will reflect all rooms to be accessible by your CleanBot, along with the flooring type of each room. Additionally, you may set up "virtual walls" to wall off any rooms that you want to make inaccessible to your CleanBot. Once the process of creating your map is complete, you will be able to see a visual representation of the map under the **Map** tab in the navigation bar. You will also be able to see the location of each of your CleanBots as well as which rooms have been marked as clean. 

# Operating your Robot
## Scheduling Cleanings
To assign your robot with a task, click on the **Schedule** tab in the navigation bar. This will bring you to a page where you are able to make selections using a series of drop-down menus to indicate the logistics of your clean. Using this page, you are able to specify which robot you would like to execute the clean, which room the robot will clean, when the clean will execute, the cleaning type, and the priority of the clean. Once you have made your selections, you may press the "Schedule" button to initiate the clean!

## Cleaning Modes
When you assign a cleaning task to your CleanBot using the Cleanly app, you are able to choose between a variety of cleaning modes designed to improve the quality of cleaning for different flooring types. These types include Scrub, Sweep, Mop, and Spot Treatment. You are able to specify your preferred cleaning mode using the "Clean Type" drop-down menu under the **Schedule** tab in the navigation bar.
